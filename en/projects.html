						I've coded my personal website (the one you're on) and use it as a portfolio.
						<br>
						It was designed as a learning project, so I decided not to use a template that had already been made. 
            So I developed and applied my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to create this site. 
            I continue to update it with new experiences and projects.
            And I still have to adapt it to the phone format, as there are many scalling problems.
						<br>
						<br>
						I've integrated my own drawings in the background of each page, bringing a personal touch to my site. 
            You can have the original version of the drawings by clicking on the images.
						<br>
						<br>
						The code is available on <a href="https://github.com/mathcoutant/mathcoutant.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

						My final-year engineering school project involves including a text-generating AI in a role-playing scenario editor. 
            The role-playing game editor already available is for the game called <a href="https://www.aidedd.org/univers/laelith/" target="_blank">Laelith</a>.
						<br>
						<br>
						With our code, the script writer will only have to provide a short description of the action and, if desired, the various results of the extract he's interested in. 
            The AI then writes the text describing the action. 
            This saves the writer a lot of time, and may even lead to some original ideas.
						<br>
						<br>
						The main challenge is to restrict the AI to the role-playing universe. 
            It needs to build on existing descriptions and not invent important new elements of the universe while remaining creative.
						<br>
						We also had to include an interface in an existing project, which meant analyzing the code and rethinking the design of our solution to keep it instinctive.

					<h1>Erosion Simulation</h1>
					<p class="gray_text">
						The aim of this project is to create an erosion simulator using shaders. 
            Everything happens in the graphics card, where a compute shader iterates over the terrain to simulate erosion.
						<br>
						<br>
						The main difficulty of this project was to work directly on a 3D terrain made up of voxels.
						Indeed, most existing simulators work on a 2D plane that will be deformed.
						<br>
						<br>
						You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/mathcoutant/Terrain_Erosion" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

					<h1>Wattfor</h1>
					<p class="gray_text">
						This is a school project to assess the power consumption of massively multiplayer video games, in particular Fortnite.
						<br>
						<br>
						To do this, we measured the game's power consumption on different configurations. 
						This gives us an estimate of average client-side consumption.
						To estimate server-side consumption, we wrote a C script simulating the network exchanges that take place between a server and 100 clients.
						<br>
						<br>
						The result of this study is that server-side consumption is highly optimized and almost negligible compared to client-side consumption.
						To reduce the consumption of this type of game, it is therefore essential that client-side games are optimized.
						<br>
						You can find our report in French <a href="../assets\wattfor.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> and the simulation code on <a href="https://github.com/mathcoutant/Wattfor" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

						To discover and learn the C++ language, I developed a little game with a friend.
						<br>
						<br>
						To do this, we used the SFML library, which facilitates the creation of games.
						The game remains simplistic, but has enabled us to understand the basics of the language and how it works.
						Particularly with regard to pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) and data storage.
